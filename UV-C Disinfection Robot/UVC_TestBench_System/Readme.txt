This is the intial commit for the UVC Sensor System testbench file.
As of now, the ADC has been intialized, and the values are read through to
a screen based Putty terminal @ 152000 bps

The intial device is using a potentiometer for mimicing the sensor, as I need to discuss with
Doug Wagner safety with the UVC lights
